Desaster Recovery Linux Server is written entirely in Bash and does not 
require any external programs. However, the rescue system that is created by

rescue system work:

All other required programs (like sort, dd, grep, etc.) are so common, that
we don't list them as requirements. In case your specific workflow requires

To view/verify your configuration, run +rear dump+. It will print out the
current settings for +BACKUP+ and +OUTPUT+ methods and some system information.

To create a new rescue environment, simply call +rear mkrescue+. Do not forget
to copy the resulting rescue system away so that you can use it in the case of
a system failure. Use +rear mkbackup+ instead if you are using the builtin
backup functions (like +BACKUP=NETFS+)

To recover your system, start the computer from the rescue system and run
+rear recover+. Your system will be recovered and you can restart it and
continue to use it normally.

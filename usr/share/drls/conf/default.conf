# PLEASE NOTE:
#
# * Here we define and describe ALL configuration variables and set them to a sane
#   default. Please do NOT change them here, but rather copy them to site.conf or
#   local.conf
# * Most variables can be set to an empty value (VAR=) which means that this
#   setting is off or set to some automatic mode.
# * Boolean variables can be set to anything as we only check wether the variable
#   is not empty.
# * Some variables are actually bash arrays and should be treated with care.
#   To set an empty array, use VAR=().

# These variables are used to include arch/os/version specific stuff
